# Inspiration

We were inspired by finding new ways to promote eating fresh, locally grown produce. We wanted to create a website that provides growing information and cooking tips for vegetables that inspire people to eat more healthily and sustainably, while also promoting a deeper connection with the natural world and the food we eat.

# What it does

Veggie Vitals is your one-stop-shop for all things related to growing and cooking fresh produce. We offer a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in growing their own fruits and vegetables, providing detailed information on how to grow a wide variety of produce, including tips on planting, watering, fertilizing, and harvesting. In addition to growing tips, we also have an AI-powered recipe generator that suggests delicious and nutritious recipes based on the produce you grow. Simply input the produce you have available, and our AI will generate a list of recipes tailored to your specific ingredients. Our recipes are designed to be healthy, easy to make, and delicious.

# How we built it

We used many resources to build Veggie Vitals, including using OpenAi, React, and Autocode for the first time. We created our graphics using Photoshop and Figma, and then coded our website in React using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

# Challenges we ran into

Everything was initially going to be coded on Autocode, but there were too many issues with finding adequate resources to help with using the application for the first time. As well, two of our members had never used Git or Github before the hackathon. Inevitably, we ran into issues with downloading Git and accessing the repository from Github. After coding, syncing our changes didn’t always work out in the way we wanted it to.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud of learning Autocode to create customized AI responses for people interested in growing and cooking their own produce. Our AI-powered recipe generator is a unique feature that sets us apart from other gardening and cooking resources, and we're proud of the work we've done to create a tool that's both practical and innovative.

# What we learned

During this hackathon, our team had the challenge of learning to code in React and Autocode without any prior experience. Since this was the first Hackathon for two of our members, we needed to learn how to manage our time in order to complete a project within a short two-day window. ElleHacks was a challenging experience, but we're extremely grateful to walk away with new skills, connections, and accomplishments.
